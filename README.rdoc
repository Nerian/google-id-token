= GoogleIDToken

GoogleIDToken currently provides a single useful class "Validator", which provides a single method "#check", which parses and validates an ID Token allegedly generated by Google auth servers.

Creating a new validator takes a single optional hash argument. If the hash has an entry for :x509_key, that value is taken to be a key as created by OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new, and the token is validated using that key.  If there is no such entry, the keys are fetched from the Google certs endpoint https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs.

=== Installation

<b>This is a fork from: https://code.google.com/p/google-id-token/</b>

  gem 'google-id-token', github: 'Nerian/google-id-token'

=== Examples

  validator = GoogleIDToken::Validator.new
  jwt = validator.check(token, required_audience, optional_client_id)
  if jwt
    email = jwt['email']
  else
    report "Cannot validate: #{validator.problem}"
  end


  cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read('my-cert.pem'))
  validator = GoogleIDToken::Validator.new(:x509_cert => cert)
  jwt = validator.check(token, required_audience, required_client_id)
  if jwt
    email = jwt['email']
  else
    report "Cannot validate: #{validator.problem}"
  end
